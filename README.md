## üí°Introduction

In big projects, app is generally divided in several modules and in such cases, if any individual 
module is just a data module (_not having UI_) and need to know state of a permission, it's not 
that easy. This library provides a way to know state of a permission throughout the app and 
from any layer of the application safely. 

_For example, you can listen for state of contacts permission in class where you'll instantly show
list of contacts when permission is granted._ 

It's a simple and easy to use library. Just Plug and Play.

## üöÄ Implementation

You can check [/app](/app) directory which includes example application for demonstration.

### 1. Gradle setup

In `build.gradle` of app module, include this dependency

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "dev.shreyaspatil:permission-flow:permission-flow-android:$version"
    
    // For using in Jetpack Compose
    implementation "dev.shreyaspatil:permission-flow:permission-flow-compose:$version"
}
```

_You can find latest version and changelogs in the [releases](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/permission-flow-android/releases)_.

### 2. Initialization

Before using any API of the library, it needs to be initialized before.   
Initialize **PermissionFlow** as follows (For example, in `Application` class):

```kotlin
class MyApplication: Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        PermissionFlow.init(this)
    }
}
```

### 3. Observing a Permission State

#### 3.1 Observing Permission with `StateFlow`
A permission state can be subscribed by retrieving `StateFlow<PermissionState>` or `StateFlow<MultiplePermissionState>` as follows:

```kotlin
val permissionFlow = PermissionFlow.getInstance()

// Observe state of single permission
suspend fun observePermission() {
    permissionFlow.getPermissionState(android.Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS).collect { state ->
        if (state.isGranted) {
            // Do something
        }
    }
}

// Observe state of multiple permissions
suspend fun observeMultiplePermissions() {
    permissionFlow.getMultiplePermissionState(
        android.Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS,
        android.Manifest.permission.READ_SMS
    ).collect { state ->
        // All permission states
        val allPermissions = state.permissions

        // Check whether all permissions are granted
        val allGranted = state.allGranted

        // List of granted permissions
        val grantedPermissions = state.grantedPermissions

        // List of denied permissions
        val deniedPermissions = state.deniedPermissions
    }
}
```

#### 3.2 Observing permissions in Jetpack Compose

State of a permission and state of multiple permissions can also be observed in Jetpack Compose application as follows:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ExampleSinglePermission() {
    val state by rememberPermissionState(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)
    if (state.isGranted) {
        // Render something
    } else {
        // Render something else
    }
}

@Composable
fun ExampleMultiplePermission() {
    val state by rememberMultiplePermissionState(
        Manifest.permission.CAMERA
        Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION,
        Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS
    )
    
    if (state.allGranted) {
        // Render something
    }
    
    val grantedPermissions = state.grantedPermissions
    // Do something with `grantedPermissions`
    
    val deniedPermissions = state.deniedPermissions
    // Do something with `deniedPermissions`
}
```

### 4. Requesting permission with PermissionFlow

It's necessary to use utilities provided by this library to request permissions so that whenever permission state 
changes, this library takes care of notifying respective flows.

#### 4.1 Request permission from Activity / Fragment

Use [`registerForPermissionFlowRequestsResult()`](https://patilshreyas.github.io/permission-flow-android/docs/permission-flow/dev.shreyaspatil.permissionFlow.utils/register-for-permission-flow-requests-result.html) method to get `ActivityResultLauncher`
and use `launch()` method to request for permission.

```kotlin
class ContactsActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private val permissionLauncher = registerForPermissionFlowRequestsResult()

    private fun askContactsPermission() {
        permissionLauncher.launch(Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS, ...)
    }
}
```

#### 4.2 Request permission in Jetpack Compose

Use [`rememberPermissionFlowRequestLauncher()`](https://patilshreyas.github.io/permission-flow-android/docs/permission-flow-compose/dev.shreyaspatil.permissionflow.compose/remember-permission-flow-request-launcher.html) method to get `ManagedActivityResultLauncher`
and use `launch()` method to request for permission.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Example() {
    val permissionLauncher = rememberPermissionFlowRequestLauncher()
    
    Button(onClick = { permissionLauncher.launch(android.Manifest.permission.CAMERA, ...) }) {
        Text("Request Permissions")
    } 
}
```

### 5. Manually notifying permission state changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

If you're not using `ActivityResultLauncher` APIs provided by this library then 
you will ***not receive permission state change updates***. But there's a provision by which 
you can help this library to know about permission state changes.

Use [`PermissionFlow#notifyPermissionsChanged()`](https://patilshreyas.github.io/permission-flow-android/docs/permission-flow/dev.shreyaspatil.permissionFlow/-permission-flow/notify-permissions-changed.html) to notify the permission state changes
from your manual implementations.

For example:

```kotlin
class MyActivity: AppCompatActivity() {
    private val permissionFlow = PermissionFlow.getInstance()
    
    private val permissionLauncher = registerForActivityResult(RequestPermission()) { isGranted ->
        permissionFlow.notifyPermissionsChanged(android.Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS)
    }
}
```

### 6. Manually Start / Stop Listening ‚ö†Ô∏è

This library starts processing things lazily whenever `getPermissionState()` or `getMultiplePermissionState()` is called
for the first time. But this can be controlled with these methods:

```kotlin
fun doSomething() {
    // Stops listening to the state changes of permissions throughout the application.
    // This means the state of permission retrieved with [getMultiplePermissionState] method will not 
    // be updated after stopping listening. 
    permissionFlow.stopListening()
    
    // Starts listening the changes of state of permissions after stopping listening
    permissionFlow.startListening()
}
```
