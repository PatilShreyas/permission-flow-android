## üí°Introduction

In big projects, app is generally divided in several modules and in such cases, if any individual 
module is just a data module (_not having UI_) and need to know state of a permission, it's not 
that easy. This library provides a way to know state of a permission throughout the app and 
from any layer of the application safely. 

_For example, you can listen for state of contacts permission in class where you'll instantly show
list of contacts when permission is granted._ 

It's a simple and easy to use library. Just Plug and Play.

## üöÄ Implementation

You can check [/app](/app) directory which includes example application for demonstration.

### Gradle setup

In `build.gradle` of app module, include this dependency

```gradle
dependencies {
    def permissionFlowVersion = "1.0.0"
    implementation "dev.shreyaspatil:permission-flow:permission-flow-android:$permissionFlowVersion"
    
    // For using in Jetpack Compose
    implementation "dev.shreyaspatil:permission-flow:permission-flow-compose:$permissionFlowVersion"
}
```

_You can find latest version and changelogs in the [releases](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/permission-flow-android/releases)_.
